This app demonstrates a simple full stack application with a front end implemented with HTML/CSS and elements from Bootstrap and the backend implemented with Node.js and Express. HTML templating is done with Handlebars.js.

The user may enter a burger name to add it to the menu. This simultaneously adds the new burger entry into the MySQL database. The initial burger entry is added as available on the menu and placed on the left side of the screen. The user may then eat any burger by clicking on it, which moves it into the devoured column on the right side of the screen and updates its status in the database.
